#

Thank you for downloading the Podcast Plugin for Movable Type. Below 
are the manual install instructions this plugin.

Before we proceed, make sure each of the following prerequisites have
been satisfied.

PREREQUISITES

  * User has MovableType 4.01 or greater installed
  * User has LWP installed

INSTALLATION

1) Install the plugin's files.

   To install this plugin, unpack the plugin's archive. Then
   copy the contents of Podcast's mt-static directory into 
   Movable Type's mt-static directory:

   > cp -pR Podcast-1.0/mt-static/* /path/to/mt/mt-static/

   Then copy the contents of Podcast's plugins folder to 
   Movable Type's plugins folder:

   > cp -pR Podcast-1.0/plugins/* /path/to/mt/plugins/

   In the event that you are unable to unpack the plugin's archive
   directly on the server, you may need to install the files manually.
   To do this, each of plugin's files needs to be placed in a
   specific directory, as outlined below:

     plugins/Podcast/lib/Podcast/*  
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/Podcast/lib/Podcast/
     plugins/Podcast/tmpl/*              
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/Podcast/tmpl/
     plugins/Podcast/Podcast.pl     
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/Podcast/Podcast.pl

     The following files are static files and must be placed in your static
     web path. By default this is $MTHOME/mt-static.

     mt-static/plugins/Podcast/*
           ==> $MTHOME/mt-static/plugins/Podcast/

2) Set Your StaticWebPath.

   Podcast makes use of a freely available flash file to stream MP3 files
   from your blog. This must be accessible via a web browser.

   To change your static web path, open up your mt-config.cgi file and look 
   for the following lines:

     # If you place all of your MT files in a cgi-bin directory, you
     # will need to place the directory containing your static files
     # (mt-static) elsewhere, so that the webserver will not try to execute
     # them.  StaticWebPath is the path to your mt-static directory.
     #
     # StaticWebPath http://www.example.com/mt-static

   Set the value of StaticWebPath to the fully qualified URL of your
   mt-static directory.

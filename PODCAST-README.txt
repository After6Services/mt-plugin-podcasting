OVERVIEW

The Podcasting Plugin for Movable Type allows users to easily link to
and include MP3 at any URL in their Movable Type blog and to manage 
those podcasts as assets within Movable Type's asset management
system.

FEATURES

1.0
* Link to any podcast on the Internet. All you need is a URL.
* Let the plugin automatically extract the content type and content
  length of the podcast being linked to.
* Automatically embed a streaming, flash based MP3 player into your 
  posts to allow your readers to listen to your content easily.
* Manage podcasts as assets within Movable Type's asset management
  system.

1.1
* Added steps to authenticate users trying to link to protected
  and private MP3s and podcasts. Plugin will now prompt the user
  for a username and password to access the podcast.
* Added support for capturing the duration of a podcast, and a 
  subtitle for the podcast

HOW IT WORKS

Once a podcast is in Movable Type's asset management system one 
can then use Movable Type's default template tags to encode podcasts
as enclosures within RSS and Atom Feeds.
